## **Introduction**  
The project aims to enhance user experience and interface design following HCI principles and user requirements.  

- The process began with **user research**, including interviews with participants from diverse age groups, genders and varying knowledge levels in the domain.  
- Based on the findings, rough sketches of the interface were created, followed by a **horizontal storyboard** as a low-fidelity prototype.  
- Feedback was gathered through subsequent interviews to align the design with user expectations and requirements.  
- The final vertical prototype was implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and relevant libraries.
